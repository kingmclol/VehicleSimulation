# Vehicle Simulation
A project for ICS4U. Yes, it's that project. **Don't do it, I swear to god.**

I guess this was also the first time I used git for a local repository, so pardon the *terrible* commit names. I thought I was sounding cool, but in hindsight it's just stupid.

The code is terrible. **Don't try it, you'll lose more than what you gain.**

I *would* do like a "how to play guide" but it's greenfoot. If you know, you know. If you don't, you don't need to know.

Maybe I'll have a change of heart later and make this README actually, you know, a README. But that's for later.

# Sound & Art Credits
It's somewhere in one of the files. Maybe `VehicleWorld.java`. Hope I'm not violating anything.
